# ASL Alphabet Recognition
This repository contains code for building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The ASL Alphabet dataset used in this project consists of images representing each letter of the ASL alphabet in American Sign Language. The dataset is organized into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x /
* TensorFlow 2.x
* OpenCV
* Pillow
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* split-folders

## Usage
1) Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASL_Alphabet_Recognition.git
cd asl-alphabet-recognition
```
2) Install dependencies:
``` bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Run the code:
```bash
Copy code
python asl_alphabet_recognition.py
```
## Results
